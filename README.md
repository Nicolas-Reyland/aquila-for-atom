# aquila-for-atom

This is an Aquila grammar package for the Atom editor.

To install it, ```cd``` in the repo directory and type:
```
apm link
```

All your **\*.aq** files will be affected by this grammar package (aesthetics only).

An official atom package will be release shortly (under the same name as this repo)
